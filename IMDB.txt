Project Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Import the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
Load the dataset from the 'imdb_top_1000.csv' file.
Perform an initial examination of the dataset, including displaying the first few rows and checking for missing values.
Convert the 'Gross' column to a numeric format and extract the numeric part of the 'Runtime' column.
Handle missing values in the 'Certificate', 'Meta_score', and 'Gross' columns by replacing them with appropriate values.
Data Visualizations:

Explore the distribution of movies over the years using a histogram.
Analyze the distribution of genres and extract the primary genre for each movie.
Create a bar plot to visualize the count of movies by genre.
Examine the runtime distribution of movies, including adding mean lines for different genres.
Investigate the relationship between movie gross earnings and the number of votes using a scatter plot.
Identify and visualize the top 3 movies with the highest gross earnings.
Analyze and visualize the distribution of ratings (IMDB_Rating) using a bar plot.
Explore the distribution of certificate ratings using a bar plot.
Analyze the distribution of meta scores and visualize the top 10 movies with the highest meta scores.
Investigate and visualize the top 10 directors with the most movies in the dataset.
Explore the top 5 stars in various roles (Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4) using bar plots.


Conclusion:
The IMDB EDA project aims to provide valuable insights into the dataset of IMDB movies, offering information about movie trends, genres, ratings, and cast members. Through data preprocessing and a variety of visualizations, this project allows users to explore and understand the characteristics of the movies in the dataset.
